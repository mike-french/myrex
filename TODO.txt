* Repeat process node

* {N,M} repeats, including {N,} syntax for 'or more'

* Character classes: scripts, categories

* Line matching $ ^

* More Elixir Regex (PCRE) options

* Named groups (?<name>...) or (?'name'...)

* Process behaviour? init/postfun, attach, match

* Process runtime monitoring 
  
* Clarify behaviour of top-level RE as string

* Clarify build-time and run-time options
  especially group captures, names, etc.

* Unicode escapes in the RE, with all string conversions

* Performance tests

* Make Graph accept procs not pids
  maybe lift proc tuples to have a :proc tag
  but performance hit of tuple construction,
  copying and destructuring
  
* Add generator function to the NFAs
  Use constant factor option for decay of 'more'
  
* Add captures to searches
