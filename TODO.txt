* Repeat process node, with stack of iteration counts in the traversal state

* {N,M} repeats, including {N,} syntax for 'or more'

* Character classes: scripts, categories

* Line matching $ ^

* More Elixir Regex (PCRE) options

* Process define behaviour? init/postfun, attach, match

* Process runtime monitoring and assert for create/teardown
  
* Clarify behaviour of top-level RE as simple char sequence

* Clarify build-time and run-time options
  especially group captures, names, etc.

* Performance tests

* Use the Regex library to compare REGEX validity,
  results and performance.

* Make Graph accept procs not pids
  maybe lift proc tuples to have a :proc tag
  but performance hit of tuple construction,
  copying and destructuring
  
* Add generator function to the NFAs
  Use constant factor option for decay of 'more'
  Create new BeginAnd node for negated char classes, no-op for traversals 
  
* Interface and test for parallel streaming of input strings

* Catch exceptions and return error tuple at top level Myrex
