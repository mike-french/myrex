* Repeat process node

* {N,M} repeats

* Character classes

* Line matching $ ^

* More Elixir Regex (PCRE) options

* Two executor modes: 
    independent one-shot
    single network, traversal IDs
  Also link processes, trap exits and crash promptly
    
* Push files down into myrex directory

* Named groups 

* Function interface for events like attach
  or at least tag messages {:attach, pid()}

* Process behaviour

* Process runtime monitoring and assert eventually

* Process dump to DOT

* Handle multiple matches from greedy/non-greedy alternatives.
  Perhaps a greedy AST optimizer that fuses compatible operators.
  For example `a+a*` -> `a+`
